# botw-recipe

Core library for the cooking simulator and WMC database.

This package is designed to be integrated into other applications to provide
cooking simulation. For example, the WMC recipe searcher, cooking simulator
CLI, and the IST simulator.

The cooking simulator was adopted from https://github.com/savage13/cooking.rs.
The appropriate license can be found in src/cook/LICENSE.txt. I have massively
improved its performance
